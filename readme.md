# Refactoring Examples (Fowler) — C# Translation

This repository contains example code adapted from *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* by **Martin Fowler**.  
The original examples were published in JavaScript on the public refactoring catalog:  
<https://refactoring.com/catalog/>

All examples in this repository have been **translated from JavaScript to C#**.  
The intent is educational: to illustrate specific refactorings and make them easier to explore in a .NET environment.

## Notes

Some constructs don’t translate 1:1 from JavaScript to C#.  
Where necessary, small adjustments were made for clarity or idiomatic usage, while preserving the original design lesson.
